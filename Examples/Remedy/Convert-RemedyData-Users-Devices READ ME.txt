This script performs several key functions aimed at processing and importing Remedy data (specifically users and devices) into a Juriba instance using bulk import techniques for efficiency. 

Initialization and Setup: 
The script starts by importing necessary modules and setting up parameters such as the API endpoint, API key, import names, and a flag for console logging. It defines global parameters to be used throughout the script.

Logging Setup: 
Utilizes a custom logging module to start logging operations, capturing and recording significant events, parameters, and errors as the script progresses.

Data Preparation:
Reads JSON data from a specified file path, which contains Remedy data about users and devices.
Initializes two System.Data.DataTable objects, one for users and one for devices, preparing them to hold mapped data from the JSON file.
Data Mapping and Validation:

Iterates through the JSON data, mapping relevant information to the corresponding DataTables for users and devices.
For users, it checks for duplicate entries based on user IDs to ensure that each user is processed only once.
For devices, it validates the presence of a serial number for each device entry. If a serial number is missing, the device entry is skipped, and a log entry is made to indicate the omission.

Custom Field Handling: 
Dynamically maps custom field values for both users and devices if they are present and not just whitespace, adding these as additional columns in the respective DataTables.

Bulk Import Preparation: 
Constructs parameter objects ($paramsForUserBulkImport and $paramsForDeviceBulkImport) containing necessary details such as the instance endpoint, API key, DataTables, and batch sizes for the bulk import operations.

Bulk Import Execution:
Utilizes custom functions (Invoke-JuribaBulkImportUserFeedDataTable and Invoke-JuribaBulkImportDeviceFeedDataTable) to perform bulk import operations for both users and devices into the Juriba system.
These functions are called with the prepared parameter objects using PowerShell splatting to simplify passing multiple parameters.
Implements error handling to catch and log any exceptions that occur during the bulk import process, ensuring any issues are recorded for troubleshooting.
Logging and Cleanup: Closes the logging session and performs any necessary cleanup before the script terminates
